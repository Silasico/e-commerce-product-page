## Overview

### The challenge

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This project taught me a lot both in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was able to use a lot of flexbox and css grid component in this same project as well as using javascript DOM manipulation to change the elements in the Markup. I also learnt that we can use multiple media queries in order to make my design responsive and without using bootstrap. I also learnt how to use the positions in CSS and the z-index components well especially coupled with displaing the cart box and removing it so the elements can be clickable.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

i will continue to learn more on using JavaScript especially writing function with arguments and parameters as well as manipulating the DOM using arrays and also looping through arrays and nodelist as well.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to give thanks to the Almighty God for the geace to start and finish this small project. It wasnt easy actually but i was able to do this myself. I know I'll still progress in programming and later move on from a front end learner to both a frontend developer as well as a backend guru.
